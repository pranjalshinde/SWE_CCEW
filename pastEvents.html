                <h2>Career Opportunities for Women in Defence By Wing Commander Rocky Rodrigues (Retd.)</h2>
                
                <h4>Event Details:</h4>
                <p>Date : 15th September, 2020
                <br>Time : 11 am.</p>
                <p>
                    On the occasion of Engineer's Day, Society of Women Engineers (SWE CCEW) had organised
                    an online talk on Career Opportunities for Women in Defence with a special reference to
                    the Air Force.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The session was conducted by Wing Commander Rocky Rodrigues (Retd.), who has served in
                    the Indian Airforce for more than twenty years. He is from the Administration, Air Traffic
                    Control branch and is trained in Radar Controlling. He was the Squadron Commander of ATS
                    squadron at Gorakhpur and also served as a Principal of Admin Training Institute at
                    Belgaum. He was Chief Instructor, Outdoor Training for two years at the prestigious Air
                    Force Academy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The session covered topics related to work for women engineers in DRDO, DOT, sports,
                    DIAT, CMO and other defence related fields. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sir started the session by saying that if a person has a good qualification, if he/she has a
                    degree, then everything in life will sooner or later work out. He has heard of many cases
                    where people have completely changed their fields or career paths, even two to three
                    times, and are still doing well in their lives. There always will be a chance to bounce back.
                    Sir highlighted the fact that there are certain expectations people have from a person in
                    uniform, which they have to live up to. The rules they have to follow, the expectations they
                    have to live up to, give them motivation and they hold these very close to their heart.
                    Sir explained that defence is a kind of an organisation which is non-political, non-religious,
                    and there is no reservation of any kind to gain entry into defence, which is the beauty of it.
                    If there is no kind of reservation, the candidates chosen are selected entirely on their merit
                    and that is the reason why we can sleep peacefully at night while it is them who are
                    protecting us even in extreme conditions like cold weather or deserts.
                    Sir shared anecdotal experiences from his own life to make everyone understand the kind of
                    sacrifices defence officers have to make in order to fulfil their duty. Apart from that, the
                    audience was also introduced with the perks of being in defence. A person in defence fields
                    has a chance to become the member of prestigious clubs, he/she gets to travel the length
                    and breadth of the country, they get to know about various cultures, they get transfers at
                    different places which they would have never been able to visit normally. The opportunities
                    are galore and the work environment is amazing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sir shared the history of ladies working in the defence services, how he worked with the first
                    batch of 12 women officers 28 years ago, and the kind of integrity, dedication and zeal the
                    women officers had, to do as good as their male counterparts.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Then, Sir, touched upon the fields which were available for the audience, which mainly was
                    comprised of women engineers. He laid out all the rules and criteria to join defence, be it,
                    army, navy, or air force. However, he made emphasis on the fact that whatever you are
                    doing now, be the best in it because that will be favourable for you while joining. He said
                    that the basic criteria are that you should be well qualified, should be physically fit, have to
                    develop your communication skills, should have command over your language, and most
                    importantly, you should inculcate moral and ethical values intrinsically. The board will judge
                    you on your leadership skills, the ability to motivate yourself and the people around you,
                    and the ability to make tough decisions like national decisions in times of crisis.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sir explained about the selection process and how it is very strict in nature since there is no
                    reservation of any kind. He said that sometimes the entire batch is washed out and not even
                    a single candidate is selected. This is because they are extremely specific about their criteria.
                    He even explained the examination process which consists of physical tests, some tests
                    which test your thinking ability, group discussions, etc.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sir told us that the selection committee does not look for some super intelligent people but
                    normal people with a good thinking ability. He also said that engineers not only have the
                    option of becoming technical officers in the aeronautical fields but also the option of
                    becoming pilots. In fact, 70 to 80 percent of the pilots are engineers. Engineers have an
                    option to become technical officers, pilots, administrative officers or something in logistics.
                    Then the session was open for questions and Sir answered all the questions in detail and
                    patiently. Topics like opportunities in DRDO, post retirement opportunities, air traffic
                    control, fighter controllers, the examinations like EKT and AFCAT for engineers and the
                    selection criteria for them, the height restriction for women, some doubts about eye vision,
                    opportunities after MS, were taken up during the question and answer session. Sir ended
                    the session by wishing us well and encouraging us to join defence related fields.

            <div class="event" id="eve2">
                <h2>Online Mental Health Session by Dr. Ambrish Bhatt</h2>
                <h4>Event Details:</h4>
                <p>Date : 20th June, 2020
                <br>Time : 11 am.</p>
                <p>
                    An online mental health session by Dr. Ambrish Bhatt, was conducted for the students and
                    staff of CCEW. Dr. Bhatt gave us a really interesting and thought-provoking session which
                    inspired everyone to focus on their strengths and improve the points which need
                    improvement.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Dr. Bhatt has been facilitating human resource development for the past 22 years which was
                    evident in his talk. He tried to teach us about how a person thinks by giving examples from
                    his own life and from the lives of the people he has helped which gave us a way to find
                    something similar in our own lives and improve on that.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One of the important points explained was that we should be responsible for our own
                    actions. Whatever we do should be a result of our own thinking and not a result of some
                    external stimulus and that we should not react and let that stimulus affect us in a negative
                    way.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The session was extremely interactive and filled with activities to help the attendees
                    understand the session better. One such activity included us writing down our strengths and
                    the points we would like to improve on (as opposed to weaknesses, a term Dr. Bhatt did not
                    like to use). He explained that writing these down would help us reflect upon them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Dr. Bhatt encouraged everyone to seek help whenever they feel it is necessary and made us
                    understand that our mental health should not affect our daily functioning. He answered all
                    the questions asked by the attendees, patiently and in detail and was open to help anyone
                    who needed his guidance.
                </p>

            <!--Mental Health Webinar by Dr. Swati Desai-->
            <div class="event" id="eve3">
                <h2>Mental Health Webinar by Dr. Swati Desai.</h2>
                <h4>Event Details:</h4>
                <p>Date : 27th June, 2020
                <br>Time : 11 am.</p>
                <p>
                    This Saturday morning students and staff of CCEW attended a Mental Health Webinar by Dr.
                    Swati Desai. The session started with a peaceful meditation session which helped everyone
                    to become aware of their surroundings and concentrate on the webinar.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One of the first slides of Dr. Swati’s presentation provided us information about the actual
                    statistics by the WHO, listing the number of people who suffer from mental health issues,
                    which is a truly shocking number and urges you to address these issues in a proper manner.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Dr. Swati made us aware about the categories of mental health issues and the different
                    types of help we can seek to address them. Her personal opinion was to seek help in a
                    combinational manner, i.e.; both psychiatrically and psychologically(i.e.; a combination of
                    medication and therapy), or any other way which a person feels can help him, be it a group
                    effort, focusing on himself, meditating, watching related YouTube videos or listening to
                    some podcasts or connecting with organisations like, The Art of Living.
                </p>
                <p>
                    She also guided us on how to deal with any friend or family member who is facing any such
                    issue. The key is to not to be judgemental and to patiently listen to them without giving any
                    unwanted advice and encouraging them to seek help if they feel it is necessary.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In her opinion, denial is certainly not an option and whichever method you may choose, it
                    will take time. Dr. Swati was incredibly calm and patient and answered all the questions
                    asked by the attendees.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The session was incredibly informative and interactive and helped everyone realize that if
                    they are dealing with some mental health issue, seeking help is important, be it through any
                    medium and that there is no shame in doing so.

            <!--A journey from swanky corporate to rural Bihar by Ihitashri Shandilya, founder and CEO of Mithilasmita-->
            <div class="event" id="eve4">
                <h2>A journey from swanky corporate to rural Bihar by Ihitashri
                    Shandilya, founder and CEO of Mithilasmita</h2>
                <h4>Event Details:</h4>
                <p>Date : 1st November, 2020
                <br>Time : 12.30 pm</p>
                <p>
                    The speaker Ihitashri Shandilya narrates the remarkable journey of her life from the
                    corporate world to entrepreneurship. Her brainchild organization Mithilasmita is an award-
                    winning social enterprise with the mission to preserve &amp; promote the heritage folk art of
                    India.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On a visit to her ancestral village in India, Ihitashri found that maintaining the sanctity of
                    traditional Madhubani paintings (also known as Mithila paintings) was no longer considered
                    worthwhile by the artists. In the name of contemporary art, the traditional style of this
                    world-famous Indian art was being distorted. Her grandmother had been working with
                    women in Madhubani art for years but was strapped for a sustainable plan. The majority of
                    the artisans are rural women and consider handicraft to be merely a hobby. However,
                    artists were willing to switch back to traditional techniques of creating artwork as long as
                    their livelihood needs were met. Handicrafts production stands next only to agriculture in
                    developing nations like India. Most of the Indian art forms are more than 1000-year-old
                    heritage, yet India supplies less than 2% of the global handicrafts demand.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Ihitashri is a pioneer in identifying handicrafts as an employment opportunity. When women
                    are economically empowered, they invest their earnings in their families. The speaker
                    comes from a modest background and had to face several problems during the early days.
                    From balancing her family life and work to her opinions not being taken seriously, she
                    overcame all the difficulties and barriers in her way to success. Her mother was her
                    strongest support system, who had her back at all times. Ihitashri, a staunch feminist,
                    believes that a woman should claim her position on the table and should never let go of her
                    credit.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The vision of Mithilasmita is to create a social ecosystem that preserves and promotes the
                    heritage of Madhubani paintings and other traditional art forms of India employing
                    generating sustainable livelihoods for the rural women artists. Mithilasmita provided direct
                    employment to over 500 artists, train 10,000 artisans, and impact over 100,000 lives in 5
                    years. It allowed the rural artists, not only to showcase their work on a bigger canvas but
                    also to earn their living through it.  Ihitashri used to work at IBM in the morning and set up a
                    gallery that she attended in the evening. As soon as she realized that her new venture
                    needed her full attention, she quit her job, devoted all of her time to Mithilasmita, and
                    focused on expanding the market. The company identified, developed, and fostered new
                    partnerships with corporates, museums, and galleries across India to have increased 
                    visibility of Milthilasmita products. Over the past eight years, the organization has
                    showcased the art form globally. To date, they have exhibited at the Rubin Museum of Art
                    in New York and GVK Jaya He Museum Store in Mumbai. They also have a folk-art gallery in
                    Bengaluru.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The speaker stressed the importance of technology in women empowerment. She put forth
                    some interesting anecdotes about how her background in technology proved advantageous
                    in networking, marketing, brand building, etc. Increased awareness through access to global
                    information is one of the key factors that benefit women entrepreneurs. Her journey is
                    indeed inspirational for all. Truly, there is no force more powerful than a woman who is
                    determined to rise.

                <h2>E-mart, where your vision turns into reality by Vasundhara Chavan</h2>
                <h4>Event Details:</h4>
                <p>Date : 1st November, 2020
                <br>Time : 11:30 am.</p>
                <p>
                    The main idea behind E mart is to create an immersive shopping experience by using
                    augmented reality (AR). The speaker shared her vision about the future of shopping malls
                    and markets and threw light on the wide potential of augmented reality to revolutionize
                    industries and enterprises.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Augmented reality is the real-time use of information in the form of text, tables, images, etc.
                    In simple words, AR overlays digitally created content into the user’s real-world
                    environment. It is a common experience that concepts are easier to grasp and remember
                    when they can be visualized. Hence the speaker says that the use of AR will surely add hours
                    to our day! It will bridge the gap between the digital and physical worlds by transforming
                    our way of working, playing, learning, and networking.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Vasundhara touched on the history of AR, stating that it was first developed in 1968 by Ivan
                    Sutherland. In 2018, Assemblr, a content creation platform that lets everyone create their
                    AR content was launched. Personal shopping mall guide, displaying restaurant ratings,
                    reviews, or school information on the screen when the camera is pointed at it are some of
                    the applications of AR. Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) offer distinct
                    experiences but share similar underlying technology. VR simulates a physical presence in
                    real or imagined worlds and allows the user to interact in that world. In contrast, AR
                    superimposes virtual objects over the real world such that the content appears to be a part
                    of the real-world scene. Mixed reality is developed by combining these two technologies.
                    Games, AR browsers, 3D viewers, GPS are a few of the common applications.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The 360-degree E mart surrounds the user with a virtual shopping environment. It is a
                    completely immersive experience that allows customers to interact with the products in an
                    as detailed way as they desire. It will seamlessly merge the real world with virtual objects by
                    the combined use of experiential retail, algorithms, and software. Experiential retail aims at
                    the convenience of the customers and benefits the sellers. The COVID-19 has given an
                    impetus to innovations by using AR technology. The aim of being socially distant but
                    virtually connected is fulfilled by AR. This has led to the positively growing trajectory of AR
                    due to increased demand for virtual experiences. From retail to education, healthcare,
                    marketing, manufacturing, emergency response, AR is positioned to drive business value
                    across sectors. The companies are quickly realizing the importance of investment in AR.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Next, the speaker explained the stepwise process of AR in smart devices. It includes image
                    acquisition, feature extraction, pattern detection and matching, geometric verification, and
                    associated information retrieval. The technologies used in E mart are Unity, Vuforia, AR
                    Core, etc. The main algorithm used is SLAM (Simulation Localization and Mapping), which is
                    an optimization problem.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To create AR feasibly and realistically at low power, the use of AR portal, Web-based AR,
                    and marker less AR are combined. AR portal allows the user to walk into another world in
                    augmented reality, while web-based AR is an AR experience held within a webpage. Marker
                    less AR means that there are no pre-programmed instructions into the device- it detects
                    items on the fly. The recognition algorithm looks for patterns, colors, and other features.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Lastly, Vasundhara addressed some of the challenges faced in AR technology. They include
                    regular content updates, maintenance, scene and object recognition training, and correct
                    display of visuals. With the rapidly growing pace of technology and innovation, these
                    challenges will be overcome soon and the future will be AR- friendly for all.

                <h2>Harnessing Technology for Social Good by Tanya Jojy and Poorva Bhalerao</h2>
                <h4>Event Details:</h4>
                <p>Date : 1st November, 2020
                <br>Time : 2 pm to 3 pm</p>
                <p>
                    One of the topics for day 3 of the Incube conference was ‘Harnessing technology for social
                    good’. Tanya Jojy and Poorva Bhalerao, the speakers, began with a poll. Many of the
                    attendees responded saying that some kind of fear pertained amongst them due to the
                    rapid progress in technology. They then threw light upon the history of technology, right
                    from the 1 st transistor in 1947, a pager, CDs, and a lot more till the recent developments in
                    artificial intelligence and machine learning. They shared few laws like Moore’s law, etc.
                    which stated the rate at which technology was progressing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    They led us to understand that almost 1 million people in the world are having some kind of
                    disability, which may be visible or invisible. E.g. Dyslexia is one such kind of learning
                    disability. This highlighted the fact that technology must be accessible to all. On the other
                    hand, the world is facing many issues like cyber-crime, hacking, pollution, stress,
                    unemployment, distraction, bad posture, violence, energy consumption, poverty, etc. They
                    also shared examples of projects which helped solve some of these issues. Devices for soil
                    sampling, the mechanism for timely consumption of TB tablets, and other low-cost
                    diagnostic tools, carbon footprint awareness were some of them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    They explained sustainable software engineering. It is a new paradigm in software
                    engineering that is guided by 8 principles of embodied carbon, energy proportionality,
                    networking, electricity, carbon intensity, measurement and optimization, carbon and
                    demand shaping. It refers to software, hardware, electrical market, climate science, data
                    center design all working hand in hand to build such technology or software which cuts
                    down energy consumption and use of resources. E.g. Microsoft’s Natick is a project in which
                    an entire data center was submerged into the sea for ensuring natural cooling.
                </p>
                <p>
                    They further spoke about the social impact revolution which can be observed by the change
                    in investments, policies, choice of careers, how funds are endowed. People are now looking
                    forward to returning on investment as well as return on humanity and are interested in
                    projects that have a vision for society. Hackathons, contributions to NGOs, to name a few,
                    are ways of becoming a part of this revolution. They also explained how involvement in such
                    projects develops a personality, helps understand people, their problems and diversity,
                    improved insights, continual innovation, etc.
                </p>
                <p>
                    They highlighted points like being aware of the social issues and thinking ways to solve
                    them, making technology cheap and accessible to all. Elaborating design thinking, they said
                    that good design is the basis of a good product. Sustainability, psychology, a good user
                    interface, and a good user experience is very important. They stated a fact that people
                    usually take into consideration, the negative effects of technology. But, if we study these
                    negative effects and think of the long-term impact of the technology before designing it,
                    then it will surely reduce them. Technology will have a bright future!

                <h2>Analysis of EMG Based wrist movement classification methods by Rucha Kulkarni</h2>
                <h4>Event Details:</h4>
                <p>Date : 31st October, 2020
                <br>Time : 3 pm to 4 pm.</p>
                <p>
                    Rucha Kulkarni was one of the speakers at the Incube Conference, 2020. Rucha is a final year
                    Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering student who is interested in Biomedical
                    Engineering research.
                    She started her talk by explaining how the use of biosignals can change the face of
                    rehabilitation engineering. Rehabilitation engineering involves developing technology to
                    help people with any kind of disability or impairment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    She went on to explain the applications of rehabilitation engineering, which are:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Prosthetics- Rucha gave the example of Bucky Barnes from avengers and his metal
                        arm and explained how the signals from the muscles or brain are used to operate the
                        arm. In the real world, this technology is not developed to that extent but is being
                        worked upon.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Human-Computer Interaction – Rucha gave the example of the IIT Bombay Techfest
                        she had visited where she witnessed a project which made use of signals from the
                        arm to operate a foot brace. This project could help people with paralysis, by flexing
                        the wrists they could send signals to move the brace up and down.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    Then, she explained what Electromyography (EMG) is and how does it work by giving
                    examples of EMG signal graphs and an explanation of the mathematical aspect of it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Rucha made sure the session was not monotonous by showing a video about wrist anatomy,
                    which depicted the wrist joint movements. It showed the muscles in the human wrist and
                    explained which muscle is used for which type of wrist joint movement and how it sends
                    signals. For an accurate result, while analysing, one needs to make sure the proper muscle is
                    used to generate a particular signal.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The talk then moved on to the technical part of EMG, which includes signal processing along
                    with some algorithm (Machine Learning or Deep Learning Algorithm or Fuzzy Logic) to
                    calculate accuracy. The flow is, first obtain the EMG signal from the particular body part,
                    figure out the time window, pre-process it (choose bandwidth), and then feature extraction.
                    Each signal has a different feature and whenever you are applying an algorithm, you need
                    specific features to extract. Then comes a proper algorithm selection and accuracy checking.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Then, Rucha shared with the audience, four different papers she had been reviewing and
                    compared the accuracy results for each of them. Each of the papers had different
                    algorithms, different numbers of features used along with some other factors. All the papers
                    were compared and it was shown how different factors can have different accuracy results.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Rucha went on to explain pre-processing and feature extraction- EMG signals are obtained
                    by EMG electrodes (Ag, Ag/Cl electrodes). The electrodes are placed at the desired muscle
                    locations to generate signals. These signals are filtered and sampled according to the
                    requirement and then a specific time window is decided. If the signals are extracted from a
                    very long window, a lot of data variation is caused, which might give a false positive or false-
                    negative result.
                </p>
                <p>
                    According to Rucha, these are the features that can be extracted- Time domain and
                    frequency domain. The time domain has standard deviation, variance, zero crossing,
                    maximum absolute value, etc. The frequency domain has waveform length, mean
                    frequency, frequency energy, peak frequency, etc. Lots of papers use different combinations
                    of these features for better accuracy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the conclusion, Rucha compared the four papers using the above-mentioned features and
                    explained how the accuracy differs.

                <p>
                    This year, The Society of Women Engineers, Cummins College of Engineering for Women
                    (SWE CCEW) chapter had organized its flagship event for the second consecutive year- The
                    Incube Conference on the 30 th , 31 st of October, and 1 st of November 2020. The theme of this
                    year’s conference was ‘Co-existence’. The conference started at 5.00 pm and Rashi Gulhane,
                    SR, SWE CCEW, gave a brief introduction about the theme of the conference.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Principal of CCOEW, Dr. Madhuri Khambete, inaugurated the conference and spoke
                    about the evolution of the institution. She highlighted the efforts of Maharshi Karve and
                    spoke about the establishment of Cummins College of Engineering for women and how the
                    SWE chapter was relevant to the institution. She put forth that, though women face a lot of
                    challenges in the male-dominated engineering field, people are gradually accepting the
                    change as women prove that they can co-exist.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Next, Dr. Anagha Kulkarni, Faculty Advisor SWE CCEW and HOD IT, applauded the
                    completion of 4 years of the establishment of the SWE-affiliate since March 2016. She gave
                    an introduction about the work of SWE CCEW and also mentioned how the Incube
                    conference has helped the students in many ways. She then introduced Dr. Anuradda
                    Ganesh who was the speaker of the day.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Dr. Anuradda Ganesh had been a professor at IIT Bombay for 25 years and is currently the
                    Director, Research and Innovation, and Chief Advisor to Chief Technical Officer at Cummins
                    India. In addition to that, she has many awards and achievements to her credit. She began
                    by stating that change is the only constant thing and how disruptive changes like the
                    ongoing pandemic, force us to leap. She stressed the need to look at a problem or any
                    situation in a very structured way by doing the following:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Accept the change</li>
                    <li>Make a priority list</li>
                    <li>Check out the list of available tools, e.g. Technology, digitalization, communication,
                        networking, etc.</li>
                    <li>Innovation, upskilling, reskilling.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    She then shared some fantastic videos regarding innovations that people had come up with
                    during the lockdown period to maintain social distancing and various safety measures. E.g.
                    Protective masks and eye ware, hands-free door handles in supermarkets, positive pressure

                    spacesuit, a vehicle that helps maintain social distancing. Throwing light upon the impact of
                    digitalization in our lives, she gave examples of ATM, Paytm, online medical consultancy,
                    online shopping, online education, online cooking tutorials, online marriage celebrations,
                    etc. She further said that it is important to forget in order to innovate; let go in order to
                    move on, adapt, and co-exist peacefully. Innovation in itself is a disruptive and a very fast
                    process. She added that creativity is the new normal and shared a video showing how the
                    convocation ceremony was organized virtually for the students of IIT Bombay. She stressed
                    the fact that creativity is not just an art but also involves science and technology. She threw
                    light on how important it is to take risks to survive. She highlighted that though there are
                    chances of robots replacing humans in many jobs, there will be many newly available jobs,
                    demanding a greater skill set. Hence, upskilling and multitasking is important. She put forth
                    the fact that women’s issues can be solved by more innovation in the field of STEM and
                    networking. She concluded by saying that creativity and innovation is the key to co-exist.

                <h2>Lifecycle of an Engine by David Green</h2>
                <h4>Event Details:</h4>
                <p>Date : 30th October, 2020
                <br>Time : 6:15 pm to 7:15 pm</p>
                <p>
                    David Green, the New Product Development Technical Leader at Cummins India, started his talk
                    by explaining what Product Life Cycle exactly is. He elaborated on how the life of a new product
                    starts, grows, and then ends at one point. The life of a new product begins from technology and
                    research, then moves on to the development, launch, growth, maturity, decline, and finally
                    obsolescence. A product goes through all these stages over a large period.
                </p>
                <p>
                    He talked about two engines- BS4 and BS6 launched by Cummins in 2017 and 2020 respectively.
                    BS4 has two engine platforms and 2 architectures with EGR and SCR variants whereas BS6 has 2
                    engine platforms and 1 architecture with SCR variant only. Explaining the product life cycle of
                    the two engines, he stated that the technology and research stage of BS6 started in 2015,
                    followed by product development in 2017 and then the launch in 2020. BS4, currently, is in the
                    product maintenance and services and support stage.
                </p>
                <p>
                    He talked about the recent launching of BS6 amidst the pandemic due to which there was a
                    significant reduction in the demand by 90%. Cummins faced a lot of challenges in
                    manufacturing and supply chain, delayed market feedback, and more. Despite all these hurdles,
                    they did a commendable job at managing everything and had a very successful launch of BS6 on
                    1 st April 2020.
                </p>
                <p>
                    He remarked that the job isn’t done once a product is launched. Launching is followed by
                    product maintenance and providing persistent services and support in various ways. To provide
                    world-class service support to the BS4 and BS6 after-treatment systems, Cummins has set up
                    more than 250 Component Care Centers to complement the Cummins engine and Tata services
                    centers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    David concluded his talk by stating the implications of the Product Life Cycle and how long-term
                    product planning and technology research needs to be aligned in a way that technology exists
                    to support timely new product development and to ensure that market-leading new products
                    are launched.

                <h2>New Normal- Navigating a once-in-life pandemic by Neha Tiwari</h2>
                <h4>Event Details:</h4>
                <p>Date : 31st October, 2020
                <br>Time : 12:30 pm to 1:30 pm.</p>
                <p>
                    Neha commenced her talk by giving a brief introduction of herself and her journey of working in
                    Cummins India for the past 15 years, initially as a mechanical engineer and now as an HR. She,
                    then, showed the audience a video about the “new normal” in which the narrator talked about
                    the pandemic and its impacts, various restrictions imposed on us, the increasing fear and
                    uncertainty, our changing lives, and how all of this is leading us to the “new normal”.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Neha observed that we’ve always had mechanisms to deal with earthquakes or storms or
                    floods but none for a pandemic and hence she informed the audience about the 3 C’s of
                    navigating the pandemic – 1. Compassion 2. Competence and 3. Change Management.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Speaking about Compassion, she first urged everyone to be self-compassionate - which involves
                    taking care of ourselves, accepting our vulnerability, and seeking help if necessary. She then
                    moved onto the importance of being compassionate to others – which involves helping and
                    supporting those in need in these difficult times and being there for someone without judging
                    them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Five different quick polls were conducted in which the audience was asked whether they had
                    faced the fear of failure, mental health decline, or loneliness during the pandemic. The results
                    of the poll concluded that the audience agreed to have faced the above-mentioned issues some
                    of the other times throughout the past few months.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Moving on to Competence, Neha reminded the audience to recognize what they’re good at and
                    to lean into it, to build their competence, and to accept that the best time to learn and to boost
                    their careers is NOW.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Finally, about Change Management, she remarked that just as the world wasn’t the same after
                    WWII, similarly, it won’t be the same after the pandemic. This pandemic has revolutionized our
                    lives and has paved a way for remote working, online learning, changing business management
                    techniques, video-streaming, and E-Commerce, and everyone is adapting to this change.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Neha concluded by showing the audience a video on the infamous story of the eagle shredding
                    its skin midway through its life for rebirth. She reminded us, hence, to adapt, accept, and
                    
                    change as required. To keep hoping and moving. And finally, to keep navigating the pandemic
                    with the help of the 3 C’s.

                <h2>Machine Learning driven stock price prediction by Yashashree Nigudkar</h2>
                <h4>Event Details:</h4>
                <p>Date : 31st November, 2020
                <br>Time : 2 pm to 3 pm.</p>
                <p>
                    Yashashree spoke about the various technical aspects of the use of Machine Learning (ML)
                    in stock price prediction. Starting with the basic introduction to AI and ML, she went on to
                    explain the fields where AI is applicable- ranging from automation, gaming, smart devices to
                    detecting diseases, analyzing background history of people, and predictions of a variety of
                    things.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Artificial intelligence is the intelligence demonstrated by machines, unlike the natural
                    intelligence shown by humans and other animals. Machine learning, a subset of AI is the
                    study of computer algorithms that improve automatically through experience. The error
                    rate of AI predictions is observed to be decreasing every year and will match with that of
                    humans (0-5 %). However, machines lack emotional intelligence. One must not blindly trust
                    the output before analyzing it and produce the best result by combining human and
                    machine intelligence. Although it is a fact that AI poses a huge threat to job roles such as
                    telemarketers, translators, customer service representatives, etc. it has also created a
                    plethora of new job opportunities. It is the need of the hour for us to migrate and seek
                    employment in those fields.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Next, the speaker gave a brief introduction to the Indian stock market and the related
                    terminology. Sentiment and global affairs cause major changes in the stock price. For
                    several years, a copious amount of categorized data has been generated. As humans can&#39;t
                    track and analyze the data of every stock, the application of ML becomes suitable here.
                    There is always some dependency between parameters of a stock i.e. open, previous close,
                    high, low, volume, open interest, offered quantity, bid quantity, etc. and the price of the
                    stock. By studying these co-relations and dependencies, predictions of the stock price can
                    be made to maximize the profit and minimize losses.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The three basic categories of ML algorithms are Supervised learning, unsupervised learning,
                    and reinforcement learning. Neural networks can be supervised as well as unsupervised.
                    Neural networks are preferred for this application as they can recognize/identify patterns
                    and correlations in raw data. They can cluster and classify data. Not only can they learn and
                    improve continuously but also are easily scalable for larger amounts of data.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Diving into further details, Yashashree explained the main algorithm used in the process –
                    Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). Current Stock prices are dependent on the historical price
                    data of that stock. LSTM selectively remembers useful factors and improves from it.
                    Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are hard to train and may face problems of exploding and
                    vanishing gradients, which is overcome by LSTM. Previous cell state, previously hidden

                    state, and input at the current time step are the most important factors in prediction. LSTM
                    remembers the crests and troughs on the stock price chart. Usually, the data of the previous
                    60 days is analyzed for the current day predictions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To conclude, the speaker advises us to consider the ML predictions only as a guideline. She
                    highlighted the importance of the right stock market investment as an additional source of
                    income. This is just one of the examples of the ever-growing applications of technology in
                    finance.

                <h2>Proto-calling Health by Ritvi Mishra</h2>
                <h4>Event Details:</h4>
                <p>Date : 31st October, 2020
                <br>Time : 11:30 am to 12:30 pm.</p>
                <p>
                    The Incube conference started at 11.30 am on the 2 nd day of the event. Shivani Pandit
                    introduced the speaker of the day, Ritvi Mishra. Ritvi, a third-year E&amp;TC student spoke
                    about the different IoT protocols and platforms available for medical technology and its
                    significance.
                </p>
                <p>
                    She said that the coronavirus pandemic has increased the demand for health services and
                    shared one of her experiences in which health workers had to come in people’s contact to
                    read their oxygen levels, etc. This led her to think about the use of IoT in medical
                    technology. She explained that 87% of the medical devices were supposed to go wireless in
                    2020, while it was expected that all the devices had their OS, application layer by 2022.
                    However, there isn’t enough and effective implementation of currently available
                    technologies, especially in remote areas. According to research, increased health
                    consciousness among people, health parameters monitoring and alliances in the health
                    market are some of the factors that have increased the use of IoT in medical devices. E.g.
                    Fitbit has become increasingly popular among people nowadays. She also added that the
                    pandemic has caused many hospitals to implement IoT and robots.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Moving towards the protocols, she said that many different protocols are implemented in a
                    product which works together in combination. IoT can be seen in everyday examples like
                    Alexa, Google Assistant for home automation, etc. Though the framework of every protocol
                    is similar, they work very differently in different layers of activity. Every protocol has its
                    characteristic transmission bandwidth, accuracy, data integrity, and security. She spoke
                    about the MQTT protocol which was discovered in 1999 and developed by IBM. The main
                    goal of this lightweight protocol is to transmit data inexpensively when you have constraints
                    over resources. It facilitates multiple to multiple machine transmission which involves
                    publishers, subscribers, and MQTT brokers. It provides high QoS, encryption, ensures
                    message delivery, and doesn’t cause data loss during power failure which is extremely
                    necessary for medical devices. The structure of the message includes fields like a header,
                    checksum, version and protocol names, connect flag, keep alive bits, etc.
                </p>
                <p>
                    She later spoke about the ZIGBEE protocol which implements a mesh network. It controls
                    the messages sent to different machines. Its working is different as compared to MQTT
                    concerning encoding. Explaining the COAP protocol she said that it is a one to one protocol
                    which has a similar structure as that of MQTT but has lesser fields. This compromises the
                    accuracy of the message being sent. The messages for which we want an acknowledgment
                    can be marked so accordingly.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Every protocol is generated to cater to a particular need or observation. In biomedical
                    devices, the data that is generated is unique, e.g. heart rate, brain signals, oxygen levels and
                    needs different types of encryption, encoding, and processing. She explained how time,
                    accuracy, security, and encryption are most important in medical devices and told how
                    different protocols are appropriate for different applications.
                </p>
                <p>
                    She then spoke about the BLE protocol which offers very low cost and low power
                    consumption. It is a widely used technology that has a health device profile and many built
                    functions and libraries for medical technology. However, it has a byte constraint. She
                    concluded after explaining about the upcoming technology, NB-IoT.

                    about the different IoT protocols and platforms available for medical technology and its
                    significance. She shared her research done during the coronavirus pandemic and explained
                    the increased demand for health services which led her to think about the use of IoT in
                    medical technology. Throughout the session, she explained various protocols like BLE,
                    ZIGBEE, etc. which implement IoT and have applications in the health services sector.

                <p>
                    In the next session, Neha Tiwari explained about the “new normal”, about the pandemic
                    and its impacts, various restrictions imposed on us, the increasing fear and uncertainty, our
                    changing lives, and how all of this is leading us to the “new normal”. She informed the
                    audience about the 3 C’s of navigating the pandemic – 1. Compassion 2. Competence and 3.
                    Change Management. She used the metaphor of the infamous story of the eagle shredding
                    its skin midway through its life for rebirth. She reminded us, hence, to adapt, accept, and

                    change as required. To keep hoping and moving. And finally, to keep navigating the
                    pandemic with the help of the 3 C’s.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the third session of the day, Yashashree Nigudkar spoke about the various technical
                    aspects of the use of Machine Learning (ML) in stock price prediction. Starting with the basic
                    introduction to AI and ML, she went on to explain the fields where AI is applicable- ranging
                    from automation, gaming, smart devices to detecting diseases, analyzing background history
                    of people, and predictions of a variety of things. She highlighted the importance of the right
                    stock market investment as an additional source of income.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the fourth and final session, Rucha Kulkarni explained how the use of biosignals can
                    change the face of rehabilitation engineering. She explained the applications of
                    rehabilitation engineering, Electromyography (EMG) is and how does it work by giving
                    examples of EMG signal graphs and an explanation of the mathematical aspect of it. Then,
                    Rucha shared with the audience, four different papers she had been reviewing and
                    compared the accuracy results for each of them. Each of the papers had different
                    algorithms, different numbers of features used along with some other factors. All the papers
                    were compared and it was shown how different factors can have different accuracy results.
                </p>

                <h3>Day 3:</h3>
                <p>
                    The third day of the Incube conference was started by Vasundhara Chavan, sharing her
                    vision about the future of shopping malls and markets and throwing light on the wide
                    potential of augmented reality to revolutionize industries and enterprises. The main idea
                    behind E mart is to create an immersive shopping experience by using augmented reality
                    (AR). The speaker talked about AR, its applications, it&#39;s working, and also the challenges
                    faced while implementing it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The next speaker, Ihitashri Shandilya narrated the remarkable journey of her life from the
                    corporate world to entrepreneurship. Her brainchild organization Mithilasmita is an award-
                    winning social enterprise with the mission to preserve &amp; promote the heritage folk art of
                    India. The speaker stressed the importance of technology in women empowerment. She put
                    forth some interesting anecdotes about how her background in technology proved
                    advantageous in networking, marketing, brand building, etc. Increased awareness through
                    access to global information is one of the key factors that benefit women entrepreneurs.
                    Her journey is indeed inspirational for all.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One of the topics for day 3 of the Incube conference was ‘Harnessing technology for social
                    good’. Tanya Jojy and Poorva Bhalerao, the speakers, began with a poll. They then threw
                    light upon the history of technology, shared few laws like Moore’s law, and talked about
                    recent developments in artificial intelligence and machine learning. They explained
                    sustainable software engineering and spoke about the social impact revolution which can be
                    observed by the change in investments, policies, choice of careers, how funds are endowed.
                    They highlighted points like being aware of the social issues and thinking ways to solve
                    them, making technology cheap and accessible to all. Elaborating design thinking, they said
                    that good design is the basis of a good product. Sustainability, psychology, a good user
                    interface, and a good user experience is very important.

                    The last talk of Day 3 of the Incube Conference, was by Nandini Singh, a second-year E&amp;TC
                    student, who knows a thing or two about mental disorders, gave a talk on “Sensitisation in
                    Changing Times” where she mainly addressed some of the misconceptions regarding mental
                    health and provided a socio-economic perspective on the same. Nandini shared more of her
                    personal experiences and urged the audience to provide and seek help, whenever and
                    wherever the need be. She concluded her talk by quoting Dr. Brock Chisholm, the first
                    Director-General of WHO, who had declared that- “Without mental health, there can be no
                    true physical health.”

                <h3>Impact of the conference: </h3>
                <p>
                    To know about the impact of the conference on the attendees and speakers, here are a few
                    comments written by them:
                </p>
                <p>
                    “The conference started on a solid note about accepting the new normal and enhancing
                    one&#39;s skills to survive in the industry post-pandemic. All the speakers made excellent points
                    and enlightened us on various topics. I particularly liked the session-Stock Price Prediction
                    using ML by Yashashree Nigudkar. It was insightful and I learned new things. Looking
                    forward to many such knowledgeable events by SWE” - Divya Jami
                </p>
                <p>
                    “The three-day day INCUBE conference organized by SWE CCEW was indeed a wonderful and
                    enriching experience for me. This year&#39;s theme, &#39;Coexistence&#39; taught me great things from
                    compassion to creativity and sustainability. It was an opportunity not to be missed! I thank
                    the SWE team from the bottom of my heart for letting me witness such thought-provoking
                    sessions, by some amazing speakers. Looking forward to many more such events and
                    conferences!” -Sharvari M. Kulkarni
                </p>
                <p>
                    “I enjoyed the talks; I think that next time we should have a bit of hands-on as well?” - Varaa
                    Kukreti
                </p>
                <p>
                    “I enjoyed the talks of all the speakers who spoke at the Incube conference. I got to learn
                    about many different topics. Being in the documentation team, I always focused on
                    whatever they spoke which helped me a lot!” - Ruchita Herlekar
                </p>
                <p>
                    It was an enriching experience for everyone who attended the conference, as they took
                    back with them not only a lot of new knowledge but also a new perspective. The talks were
                    lively, engaging, and insightful as the speakers shared their expertise with the audience.
                    SWE CCEW and Cummins India plan to have many more events like these in the future.

                <h2>Sensitization in Changing Times by Nandini Singh</h2>
                <h4>Event Details:</h4>
                <p>Date : 1st November, 2020
                <br>Time : 3 pm to 4 pm.</p>
                <p>
                    This was the last talk of Day 3 of the Incube Conference. Nandini Singh, who is a second-year
                    E&amp;TC student and who knows a thing or two about mental disorders, gave a talk on
                    “Sensitisation in Changing Times” where she mainly addressed some of the misconceptions
                    regarding mental health and provided a socio-economic perspective on the same.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Nandini started her talk by sharing the story of her battles with mental disorders. She, then,
                    talked about myths revolving around mental health like “It’s not a disease, it’s just a phase”,
                    “It’s not real, they’re doing it for attention”, “It’s their personality”, “Mental disorders are a
                    disease of the privileged” and she focused on how, in reality, mental disorders are not
                    someone’s personality but an umbrella term for conditions like depression, anxiety or
                    schizophrenia that a lot of people suffer from, more than ever in this pandemic. These
                    disorders are very real and they affect the poor as much as they affect the rich.
                </p>
                <p>
                    According to her, psychological disorders are abnormalities of the mind that result in persistent
                    behavioral patterns that can seriously affect one’s daily functions in life, and that some of the
                    contributing factors might include chemical imbalances, childhood experiences, genetics,
                    various illnesses, prenatal exposures, and stress.
                </p>
                <p>
                    She informed the audience that WHO named India the most depressed nation in the world in
                    2018 and backed this information with some more statistical data from various sources like the
                    NIMHANS Survey of 2015-16 which states that 150 million Indians require mental health care
                    services but there are, approximately, only 4000 mental health professionals in our country.
                    She enlightened the audience with more such statistics.
                </p>
                <p>
                    She stressed the importance of being understanding about mental health conditions and
                    providing help to the ones who might be suffering from it. She talked about how we need to
                    listen and guide the ones who have such issues to seek further professional treatment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Nandini, once again, shared more of her personal experiences and urged the audience to
                    provide and seek help, whenever and wherever the need be. She concluded her talk by quoting
                    Dr. Brock Chisholm, the first Director-General of WHO, who had declared that- “Without mental
                    health, there can be no true physical health.”

                <p>
                    On the 5th of October, 2019, SWE CCEW collaborated with the Idea foundation and had students from
                    three nearby schools visit our college. Some of these have had science included in their academic
                    curriculum only a few months ago, and this was a joint initiative taken by our SWE CCEW affiliate and the
                    idea foundation which aimed at helping the kids broaden their horizons in science. Hence the
                    demonstrations and experiments were based on the theme, ‘Science in Everyday Life’.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Vice President, Mayuri, interacted with the children and got an animated and spirited response to the
                    ice-breaker games played. The kids were then asked to speak about their dreams and ambitions, while
                    some kids were more than happy to open up, some were shy of being belittled. However, some further ice
                    breaking and a little coaxing did the work. We were successful in establishing the comfort level and the
                    children were elated to share their aspirations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The kids were split into five batches and given some candy, after which they were taken to the different
                    demonstrations that the SWE members and volunteers had put up together. Since the kids belonged to
                    different grades, the volunteers elaborated on the concepts in such a manner that everyone could
                    comprehend them. The demonstrations included a water level detector circuit, lemon powered circuit,
                    some mathematics demonstrations based on circle-rectangle transformations and others on similar lines.
                    Along with the demonstrations from the members and volunteers, we also had the Robocon team of our
                    college, team Aaveg and the Baja SAE team of our college, team Zenith collaborate with us. The kids
                    visited the robocon lab to see a line sensor bot and understood the concept behind IR sensors. The Baja
                    workshop gave the students an opportunity to have a look at the lathe machines and other workshop
                    equipment. They also saw both the teams at work and their current preparations for the upcoming year’s
                    competitions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After a heavy dose of information and interaction the students were taken to the canteen to have snacks.
                    It was a heartfelt sight, as we watched the kids chirp away all their new findings to each other while
                    enjoying their snacks and drinks. And to watch them take their share of trash to the bins with no one to
                    behest them was a pride-filled moment. India has a bunch of responsible youth coming up.
                    While speaking to the kids as they were moving between the demonstrations, we asked their opinions on
                    what they had been subjected to up till then, and they all had so much to convey. In ten minutes they had more stories to tell then we could remember. And with those sparkling eyes they moved on to the next
                    demonstration with as many questions as they had about their aspirations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Here are some excerpts from the volunteers:
                    “I feel so proud about us that we've tried to put in so much effort to ignite that spark, towards knowledge
                    and science, amongst those young minds. It's not only them who've learnt something today, but I had
                    something to take back home too.”

                </p>
                <p>
                    “The happiness on the faces of the kids, their lit eyes made me feel worthwhile. They were so enraptured
                    by everything they saw and wished to perform the same experiment using the apparatus given by me.
                    Thank you SWE for giving me an opportunity to interact with these small kids.”

                <p>
                    “Today was an amazing day and I am blessed to be part of such an amazing club. It was a day filled with
                    experiences and realisation. Their insatiable hunger was inspirational. I couldn't thank you guys enough
                    for this memorable experience.”

                    This year, the Society of Women Engineers, Cummins College of Engineering for Women (SWE
                    CCEW) chapter took student development and research to a whole new level with their first flagship
                    event, The Incube Conference with the theme, “Inspiration, Innovation, and Inclusion” on October
                    12th, 2019 attended by 100 participants. The conference had eminent speakers from Cummins India
                    Limited and John Deere and student speakers from Cummins College of Engineering speaking about
                    various research topics that they had been working on. The conference started off at 9:30 am, by a
                    felicitation of the speakers for the day by Dr Madhuri Khambete, Director of MKSSS’s Cummins
                    College of Engineering, after which Ram Ottikkutti, the CTO of Cummins India gave the opening
                    keynote speech. He touched upon the theme of the conference “Inspiration, Innovation and
                    Inclusion” with respect to Leadership and gave us anecdotal examples from his own life. He talked
                    about leaders that he had encountered in his own career who, with the principles of Inspiration,
                    Innovation and Inclusion, broadened the impact that they had had on their company and people
                    surrounding them. After the keynote session, talks were going to be held in two locations in the
                    college simultaneously and students could attend the sessions whose topics appealed to them.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Neema Nair and Sameer Samudra gave a talk on Leading Inclusion about Women in Technology and
                    LGBTQ+ Inclusion in traditionally cis, hetreosexual male spaces. They talked about the importance of
                    including people from marginalized groups, giving the principle argument that they were, above all
                    else, human and should not be made to feel different on the basis of who they were. They also

                    talked about privilege and their own journeys navigating these spaces and helping others navigate
                    the corporate space as well. Then, Shivani Kamtikar gave a talk on Computational Neuroscience, and
                    spoke about the work that she had done as a part of a summer research internship in the University
                    of Notre Dame. She gave the audience a preliminary introduction to Computational Neuroscience
                    and then spoke about human relationships and computational representations of human
                    relationships, since the research project she had worked on analyzed human relationships with
                    various features like smoking, etc. She also talked about how the data for the project was collected,
                    how it was represented, how the analysis was done, and how the results were verified. Poorva
                    Bhalerao then gave a talk on Algorithms in Astronomy, starting off with the importance of
                    scheduling algorithms in Astronomy. She then talked about various approaches to the dynamic
                    scheduling algorithm problem with an analysis of each approach. She touched upon a brute-force
                    approach, a dynamic programming approach, a greedy approach and the use of Reinforcement
                    Learning in this problem statement. She had employed a greedy approach in her project. Musfera
                    Javed, an employee of Cummins India Pvt. Ltd. shed light on the topic of Data Analytics. She talked
                    about the basics that are required in the corporate world of data analysis and their importance in
                    the industry today. She was followed by a student speaker Anagha Deogankar whose chosen topic
                    was ‘Automatic Velocity Control’ and spoke about what role she played in the Robocon team of
                    CCOEW in the same field. Then, we had Ritvi Mishra talk to us about the implementation of LiFi. She
                    told us about how this new technology provides cable free communication and uses light as a carrier
                    of signals. After this talk, we paused for lunch and resumed with the sessions in an hour.

                <p>
                    Shalvika Patil spoke about Bias in human relationships and how to navigate other people’s bias and
                    recognize your own. She spoke about bias as an evolutionary instinct, developed over years, and
                    how we might be hindering ourselves if we rely or give too much importance to our biases. She
                    illustrated these concepts through various stories that helped the audience understand about
                    perception (both, our own and that of others) and the importance of assuming good intent.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Tripti Chanda then spoke of Soft Robotics where she spoke about the need for developing materials
                    that further the advancement of soft robots and the importance of soft robotics various fields. She
                    also showed us examples of robots that had been built using these ‘soft’ materials, including a robot
                    octopus that could navigate the ocean currents and a heart that emulated the pumping of the heart
                    and could provide support to patients. Stueti Gupta talked to us about Women in Leadership and
                    how women are just as capable as men to be leaders, if not more. She cited various examples of

                    women leadership in various fields and told us that there is no limit to what we can achieve if we try
                    hard enough. Tanya Jojy spoke on the topic of Software Bots. She told us about the different
                    applications of these bots and how they can affect us in our everyday lives. She also talked about the
                    technology that is required and the current work going on around it. After this, Samruddhi Deode
                    talked about Blockchain technology. She told us about how it is the base of cryptocurrency and its
                    wide range industry application in Bitcoin as well as other fields such as real estate and health.
                </p>
                <p>
                    All in all, it was an extremely enriching experience for each and everyone who attended the SWE
                    CCEW Conference and took back with them not only a lot of new knowledge but also a new
                    perspective.

                    On 19th October 2019, SWE CCEW visited the Mahilashram High School of the Maharshi Karve
                    Stree Shikshan Samstha as a part of its Social Outreach program. The Samstha has been
                    committed to “Empowerment of women through education” and has a century-long history of
                    dedicated work towards making women educated and self-reliant.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The purpose of the visit was to promote STEM(Science, Technology, Engineering, and
                    Mathematics) among young girls since it has always seen a shortage of women. Especially girls
                    from underprivileged backgrounds are barely ever encouraged to take STEM. Therefore, the
                    visit was scheduled to promote STEM education among 1000 underprivileged girls from the
                    MKSSS Samstha.
                </p>
                <p>
                    SWE CCEW sent out an email asking for volunteers from the entire college for the Sanstha visit
                    and we were amazed by the overwhelming response. These volunteers along with the Student
                    Representatives were guided by the Panel members. They were divided into groups of 4 and
                    were briefed about the experiments they had to conduct. Each group was assigned a class to
                    perform the experiments, the classes being three divisions each of grades 5th, 6th, and 7th. The
                    experiments for each grade were finalized keeping in mind the difficulty and their respective
                    curricula. The experiments included the Ideal gas experiment, introduction of conductors and
                    insulators, demonstration of electromagnetism, optical inversion among many more.

                <p>
                    The students were really enthusiastic about the experiments being conducted and interacted
                    with us without any hesitation. We conducted a small quiz in each class with questions related
                    to the experiment we had just conducted. All the students were very excited to answer the
                    questions and we gave them a toffee for each correct answer they got. There was a time when
                    all the hands were up in the air!
                </p>
                <p>
                    The entire experience was really enriching for SWE members and volunteers and it felt great
                    that we could create an impact on the lives of the girls and could encourage them to take up
                    STEM education in the future.

                    Here are some comments from the volunteers:
                    "The girls at the Sanstha school took such a keen interest in every experiment we performed.
                    Their curiosity, their passion to learn something new was really inspiring. Seeing them enjoy all
                    the activities we had planned really made my day. "
                    -Samruddhi Deode, Head of PR, SWE CCEW.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “It was great to see that the young girls were keen to learn something new and were all ears to
                    our explanation of the experiments. Their attitude towards the entire process was extremely
                    positive which inspired us to do justice to our role. The overall experience was really enriching
                    for me.” - Prerna Amarnani, Head of Administration,SWE CCEW.

                    SWE CCEW had a line-up of some amazing and interesting events which had
                    taken place during the Cummins College Techfest, Innovation. The events
                    aimed to test the technical skills of the students, challenge their creativity and
                    most importantly, gave a chance to the students to create incredible
                    memories. Some of these events gave the participants a deeper insight about
                    the women in STEM.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span>Google Assistant Quiz:</span> The quiz comprised of 20 questions based on famous
                    female engineering leaders and engineering or technology. The participants
                    could win some exciting goodies related to the theme on answering more than
                    15 questions right. The quiz created awareness among the college students
                    about women in engineering and other STEM related fields.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span>Instagram Quiz:</span> This was another fun quiz, similar to the Google Assistant Quiz
                    and was conducted on our Instagram page to grab more eyeballs. The entire
                    aim of such quizzes was to create awareness about women in STEM and social
                    media provides a great platform to do that because of its immense popularity
                    among college students. Encouragement was provided to the participants in
                    the form of exciting goodies if they were able to answer all the 20 questions
                    right.

                <p>
                    <span>Poster presentation:</span> This event was designed to emphasise the ability to
                    deliver visual presentations and raise awareness about new technologies,
                    research and female engineers who have done remarkable work in the field of
                    engineering. All entrants had to submit their poster on an A1 Size sheet one
                    day prior to the fest. Posters could be handmade or digitally made.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The posters could tell the story of a strong female engineer, new innovations in
                    engineering and technology, some research or projects the participants were
                    doing or could just explain a technology the participant found fascinating.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The theme was, “Women who persisted in engineering”, to erase the prevalent
                    mindsets and stigma around us which women have to face every day. The
                    posters enabled the students to express their feelings and gave them a
                    platform to talk about their thoughts about women in STEM through their
                    posters. It was not only an expressive but creative way as well. The phrase, “If
                    you like it then you better stick a pin in it” was extremely relevant to this event
                    as the posters were like a memory pin for the audience. Good posters with a

                    clear message are always succinct and memorable, they can arouse empathy
                    delivering your message to the hearts and minds of people with emotive visual
                    imagery demanding attention, and the amazing entries we saw during the
                    event surely did that. The event allowed the participants to get their message
                    through to a wide audience in an expressive and memorable manner.

                    A picture is worth a thousand words and surely this was proven true at the
                    PhotoBooth of SWE CCEW at the Techfest, Innovation. Students took pictures
                    at the booth with our props which had the messages, ‘STEMINIST’, ‘Be That
                    Engineer’ or ‘Sisters in STEM’ written all over them. They posted these pictures
                    on their social media platforms and tagged SWE CCEW. This was done to
                    create awareness and to celebrate the achievements of women who have
                    forged the way for those of us in science today.

                <p>
                    <span>The Solution Room:</span> This event was designed to provide solutions to real world
                    problems with the help of technology. The problems would fall under domains
                    like health, education, environment and economy. The event tested the ability
                    of the participants in coming up with a technical solution to a real-life problem

                    To inaugurate the Grey Project, a peer-to-peer mentorship program, SWE CCEW collaborated with the SWE
                    Pune affiliate to organize a series of fascinating tech- talks to enrich the students’ knowledge.
                    The event, conducted on 11 th January 2020 comprised of three talks by senior industry professionals.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The event started with the ‘Resume Writing and Interview Skills’ workshop, conducted by Vidya Jaladi.
                    She is an assistant general manager at John Deere. Having completed her Masters degree in Computer
                    Management from SPPU, she went on to pursue an executive program in Statistics Leadership from IIM
                    Indore. She started right from the basics regarding the length and format of the resume, and went on to
                    explain several points that strengthen a resume. She highlighted the importance of the title, contact
                    information, career objective, education, skills, projects, work experience, achievements sections and the
                    power verbs to use in each section. The session provided an excellent guidance to the newbies from the first-
                    year on how to draft their first resume. The more experienced students of SY, TY and final year also picked up
                    a lot of useful points to improve their interview experience. Vidya ma’am gave a lot of interview tips about
                    choosing the correct outfit, our body language, about greeting the interviewers , introducing ourselves and
                    closing the interview. Towards the end, she threw light on few controversial points of political, cultural, social
                    nature which everyone must avoid mentioning. Overall, the session was highly interactive and informative.
                    The key takeaway from it was ‘How to present the best version of the Brand- YOU’.

                    all the principles made her talk super enlightening for all. She explained how data can be generated and
                    collected through a wide variety of sources. She discussed how different types of researches are conducted
                    for collecting data and how it is analyzed later. She focused on the concept of big data and its use cases. The
                    students were able to grasp the enormity of the big data in five dimensions, considering the volume, variety,
                    velocity, variability and complexity. Her easy language and friendly interaction made the vast subject of
                    machine learning seem quite uncomplicated. Surely, the students were motivated to explore this highly
                    in-demand field in a greater depth.

                    As a part of our leadership program, SWE CCEW decided to start a program for the freshers in our
                    college. In order to build a strong career and get equipped to survive in the corporate world,
                    students need to step on the right stepping stones at the right time. Managing academics, extra-
                    curricular activities, grabbing the right opportunities at the right time, exploring and digging into
                    new fields, improving technical knowledge are a few things which all the students try to put together
                    within the four years of engineering. Thus, a holistic development as an individual is quite important,
                    which would set the students apart from the other 15 lakh engineers graduating in this country
                    every year.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In this scenario, the experiences of seniors as well as industry professionals are of great help to the
                    students which guide them throughout the four years of engineering. Keeping this idea in mind, SWE
                    CCEW introduced the Grey Project- a program including mentorship sessions as well as professional
                    industry exposure. Grey project, previously titled as Brain Dates, was a peer-to-peer mentorship
                    program. The name of the program comes from the acknowledgement of the grey cells in our brain,
                    while also considering the grey area that is left out during formal education. The settling in, the
                    personality development, the time lost to ignorance or absence of courage which can be overcome
                    by someone who has already experienced the system, cancelling out the scary grey area.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our very first event under the grey project was a mentor-mentee session- a riff on speed dating.
                    Freshers belonging to the first and second year were given an opportunity to interact with all the
                    willing mentors from the third and fourth year for a short time. During this period, they had to
                    exchange ideas regarding their areas of interest and expectations from the program. Further they
                    generated a score based on the level of commonality of thoughts. The panel members then analyzed
                    these scores, matching interests and resumes to assign a mentor to each mentee with similar
                    research content and interest area. The mentees interacted with their mentors and were provided
                    guidance on extra-curricular courses and projects. They even helped students get clarifications on
                    queries regarding preparation for interviews and internships and further regarding higher education
                    possibilities and specialization.

                <p>
                    Anand started off by talking about an incident that motivated him to get into this
                    industry. He talked about how there were so many real world problems and situations
                    that needed simple but efficient solutions and how there are several small villages in India
                    that don’t get enough electricity and water, the traffic problems we face in india and
                    proposed a few thought provoking solutions. He went on to talk about how he led his
                    team to build a satellite for NASA, the challenges they faced, how they stuck to their
                    deadline and he also explained a few of the components and its working. He also spoke
                    about LiFePO4 batteries and it’s uses. Next he spoke about how he found his projects and
                    internships only through networking and trying to solve real world problems. He
                    explained the pros and cons of studying in the US, the difficulties we as Indians face
                    during migration and he spoke about how we can apply and get into universities abroad.
                    He emphasised on the importance of interdisciplinary work and how we could solve a lot
                    of problems only through communication, learning and co-working. He also spoke about
                    start-ups and entrepreneurship. Students were encouraged to ask as many questions as
                    they wanted, to which they received satisfying answers. After the session they had an
                    opportunity to interact with him one on one. This was a very informative and inspiring
                    session.

                <p>1st September 2018.</p>
                <p>
                    SWE CCEW Affiliate organized a workshop promoting STEM education for the
                    underprivileged girls living at the MKSSS Samstha. Our primary aim was to make them
                    understand why science and technology is so important in today’s world. It was observed that
                    these girls after 10th grade would either drop out from school or take up vocational training or
                    pursue further education in the field of arts. Very few of them took up science. This was the sole
                    reason we picked the Samstha to promote STEM education hoping that we have had a significant
                    impact on atleast 10 out of the 360 girls we taught. For this session we were accompanied by 20
                    volunteers who conducted activities for these girls in Marathi.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The topic selected was SCIENCE IN EVERYDAY LIFE to encourage the students to think
                    outside the box and making them realise that everything we see around us is science. What was
                    once sheer fantasy is now almost reality by virtue of the achievements of humans in science. We
                    targeted 3 classes 8th, 9th and 10th for our session.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A few of the activities we held were- Building the tallest paper tower, explaining the litmus
                    test on acidic and basic solutions and demonstrating static electricity. There were 3-4 volunteers
                    assigned to every class. The volunteers, panel, staff and students had great fun organising these
                    activities.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It was teamwork and lots of energy that helped us make this event a success. A desire to do
                    something for society provoked our volunteers to come forward and ignite the spirit of learning in
                    these young minds.
                </p>

                    SWE CCEW Affiliate organized an introductory session on 17th August 2018 for the
                    freshers and introduced to the world of SWE! For this endeavour we were
                    accompanied by our guests Mrs. Neema Nair and Mrs. Neha Verma from Cummins
                    Inc. . Students from Cusrow Wadia Institute of Technology, Pune also joined us for
                    this session.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The session began with talk from Mrs.
                    Neema Nair which acted as an
                    icebreaker making the audience
                    enthusiastic. She briefed us about SWE
                    and how it makes a difference in various
                    walks of our life. She talked about the
                    “power pose” and how one must have
                    confidence in their own capabilities and
                    skills. Also mentioned how SWE helps
                    to network and connect with people.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Followed by her there was a presentation
                    by Mrs.Neha Verma where she talked
                    about her career path and how SWE had
                    played a vital role in her life. She shared
                    with us the “Coffee Story” which helped us
                    realize that we have all the resources, they
                    just need a proper sense of direction. We
                    also had a question-answer session, where
                    students asked questions and our esteemed
                    guests were more than happy to answer
                    them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Next Shagun Sengupta, spoke about the journey of the SWE CCEW affiliate. She
                    gave an insight of various activities that we had under the affiliate. The audience
                    were made aware of the upcoming activities and how they can be a part of SWE. To
                    end the session on a fun note we had the game bingo arranged for everyone.It made
                    the session, more interactive.

                <p>26 January 2019</p>
                <p>
                    The SWE CCEW affiliate organised a visit to the Maher ashram, an orphanage, old
                    age home for women and an institute for mentally disabled women. On the occasion of
                    the 70TH Republic day of India, the team aspired to perpetuate the fascination and
                    curiosity in the young minds of the ashram by giving them a chance to witness some
                    demonstrations of STEM based on some everyday phenomenon, like surface tension.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The session started out with a very lively welcome from the kids. As they warmed
                    up to us we helped them dive into the world of adhesion and molecules with the first
                    demonstration. The team members and the volunteers with the help of coloured water
                    and paper napkins explained the capillary action and how important a role it plays in
                    plants.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The next demonstration made the kids look around as they observed and
                    understood the very widespread phenomenon of surface tension through water pepper
                    and oil.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The dancing rice demonstration pushed the young minds to observe and
                    understand the concept of buoyancy as they simultaneously witnessed a displacement
                    reaction involving release of a gas, CO2.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The last demonstration helped the kids observe the basic concept of miscibility
                    through different coloured solutions. The innocent fascination on the kids did tempt us to
                    let them believe it magic but their curiosity and knowledge kept our temptations in check.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After some games, a lot of fun, and some brilliant dance performances we bid them
                    adieu on a very high note. The warmth of their smiles and the light in their eyes that have
                    shone upon our lives will always remain unmatched as we live on. Their contagious
                    happiness is the most privilege any of us had received. This experience was definitely an
                    overwhelming one.
